She said she would have to accomplish “some important assignment” in the coming days.“A game of destruction has started around Bangladesh, which is going through a phase of chaos and upheaval. Bangladesh, which was a role model of development across the world, has become the land of terrorists and militants. This is indeed a matter of great misfortune for us all,” said Ms. Hasina.Ms. Hasina strongly criticised the current government, led by Nobel laureate Mohammad Yunus, calling it “completely unconstitutional”. “He has come to power using money power and by stepping on the dead bodies of many people of our country,” she said and added, “There was meticulous planning by Yunus sahib to kill me and my sister.”The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Bangladesh protested “strongly” after Ms. Hasina’s speech was disseminated online. Dhaka’s concerns were conveyed to  Pawan Badhe, who is currently serving as the Head of Mission in the High Commission of India in Dhaka. “Through the protest note, handed over to the Acting High Commissioner of India in Dhaka, the Ministry conveyed the deep concern, disappointment and serious reservation of the Government of Bangladesh, as such statements are hurting the sentiments of the people in Bangladesh,” said the MOFA, Bangladesh in a press note.It was on Wednesday (February 5, 2025) that a mob called for demolishing the 32 Dhanmondi residence of Bangladesh’s founding father, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. The crowd then started dismantling the building using heavy earth-moving machinery despite police presence.In a statement, the Awami League accused the interim government of providing “immunity” and said, “Dr. Yunus and the entire interim government cannot escape liability for last night’s destructive acts.”Videos from the site showed various Islamist flags being waved from the top floors of the residence soon before the building was torn down.“The conspiracy that was made in August has now turned Bangladesh into a victim. The house was burnt in August but now they are breaking this house,” said Ms. Hasina in an emotional speech recollecting the assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman on August 15, 1975.“They can break a house but we can rebuild that house. Bangladesh will rise again. I survived repeated assassination attempts and the Almighty saved me repeatedly from danger in the past. There must be a reason for which I survived and I am sure my life was spared because I have to complete some special assignment in the coming days,” said Ms. Hasina.“Bangladesh will stage a comeback. The spirit of the war of liberation of 1971 will come back. Blood of martyrs is never wasted,” said Ms. Hasina calling on the student wing of her party to unite.The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said the demolition should be strongly condemned.  “It is regrettable that the historic residence of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, a symbol of heroic resistance of the people of Bangladesh against the forces of occupation and oppression, was destroyed on February 5, 2025. All those who value the freedom struggle that nurtured the Bangla identity and price are aware of the importance of this residence for the national consciousness of Bangladesh,” MEA official spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said.Ms. Hasina has been based in India after her government fell in the backdrop of a “student-people uprising” demanding the withdrawal of an unpopular quota system in employment. Her speech marks an important moment in her six-month long exile as it directly targeted Prof. Yunus as well as the student-coordinators, who were described as “terrorists and militants”.The interim government had called upon India to stop Ms. Hasina from speaking out earlier. It had described her earlier remarks and phone calls as interference in the domestic affairs of Bangladesh.Published - February 06, 2025 12:58 pm ISTIndia-Bangladesh
